## 📅 Planning and managing your work

All the coursework is listed as issues on this repo. There are 15 issues on this repo. 

You will copy these issues to your Coursework Planner, which is one repo that will hold all your coursework and assignments for the entire course.
I added the first two weeks. I believe it help me staying organized. 

If you do not already have your own Coursework Planner, set one up now:
